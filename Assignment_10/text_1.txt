From 2016 to 2019, Maharashtra's Green Drive aimed to plant 50 crore trees. 
By 2019, 33 crore were reportedly planted, but most lacked proof. 
In Pune, 87% of 1.7 crore saplings had no evidence. 
Many agencies skipped survival reports. 
Initial success in 2016 led to targets of 4, 13, and 33 crore in the following years. 
Tools like the My Plants app and Green Army were introduced for tracking and public participation.
